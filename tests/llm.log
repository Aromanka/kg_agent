## Guidelines

### Exercise Types
- CARDIO: Running, swimming, cycling, rowing, jumping rope
- STRENGTH: Weight lifting, bodyweight exercises, resistance bands
- FLEXIBILITY: Stretching, yoga, Pilates
- BALANCE: Balance training, tai chi
- HIIT: High-intensity interval training

### Intensity Levels
- LOW: Gentle movement, warm-up level (RPE 1-3)
- MODERATE: Sustainable effort, conversation possible (RPE 4-6)
- HIGH: Challenging, breathing heavily (RPE 7-8)
- VERY_HIGH: Maximum effort, short bursts only (RPE 9-10)

### Safety Rules
1. For beginners: Start with LOW intensity, 15-20 min sessions
2. For intermediate: MODERATE intensity, 30-45 min sessions
3. For advanced: HIGH intensity, 45-60 min sessions
4. Cardiac conditions: Avoid HIGH/VERY_HIGH intensity
6. Diabetic users: Avoid vigorous exercise during hypoglycemia risk periods
7. Always include warm-up and cool-down

## Output Format
Return a valid JSON object matching the provided schema. STRICTLY follow:
- "calories_burned": TOTAL calories for this exercise (NOT per minute)
- Use lowercase for all enum values: "cardio", "strength", "low", "moderate", etc.
- "duration_minutes": Integer (not fractional)

IMPORTANT:
- calories_burned should be realistic totals (e.g., 30 min walking = ~135 kcal, NOT 4-5 kcal).
- meal_timing must be one of: "before_breakfast", "after_breakfast", "before_lunch", "after_lunch", "before_dinner", "after_dinner".
- Generate only ONE session per day (single morning/afternoon/evening block).

## Task
Identify any safety concerns that rule-based checks might miss:
1. Hidden contraindications
2. Unrealistic progression
3. Nutrient deficiencies
4. Overtraining signs
5. Environmental mismatches
6. Conflicts with user's medical conditions

Use the Knowledge Graph context to identify potential risks, contraindications, and interactions.

The plan includes stair climbing (7 min) which could rapidly lower blood glucose. The knowledge graph suggests walking should be 20-60 minutes, but doesn't address fasting exercise risks for diabetics.",

The knowledge graph indicates 'Warm up with light aerobic exercise before stretching' for flexibility, but this principle applies to strength training too. Insufficient warm-up increases injury risk, especially for back-focused exercises.",
