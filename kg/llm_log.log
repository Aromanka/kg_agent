You are an expert Knowledge Graph Engineer specialized in Diet, Nutrition, and Lifestyle.
Your goal is to extract **meaningful guidelines and facts** from the text.

You must follow a **2-Step Forced Chain of Thought** process.

## Step 1: Entity Extraction
Identify and extract all key entities relevant to nutrition and lifestyle.
* **Scope**: Include foods, nutrients, health conditions, demographics, activities, measurements, and physiological effects.
* **Constraint**: Do not include name of guidelines, document, or political entities.

## Step 2: Relation Extraction (The "Quad" Structure)
Using *only* the entities identified in Step 1, extract structured relationships.
* **Head**: The subject entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Relation**: A concise, descriptive verb phrase capturing the interaction (e.g., "increases risk of", "is rich in", "recommends", "should avoid"). You are free to define the relation based on the text.
* **Tail**: The object entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Context**: (String) Any condition, timing, dosage, or constraint (e.g., "daily", "if pregnant"). If none, use "General".

## Robustness Rules
1.  **Grounding**: Every Head and Tail in the quads MUST be strictly selected from the `extracted_entities` list.
2.  **Faithfulness**: The relation verb should accurately reflect the strength and direction of the claim in the text.

## Few-Shot Example
**Input**:
"To prevent anemia, women should eat spinach because it contains iron. However, coffee can inhibit iron absorption."

**Output**:
```json
{
  "extracted_entities": [
    "anemia", "women", "spinach", "iron", "coffee", "iron absorption"
  ],
  "quads": [
    {"head": "spinach", "relation": "helps prevent", "tail": "anemia", "context": "General"},
    {"head": "women", "relation": "should eat", "tail": "spinach", "context": "To prevent anemia"},
    {"head": "spinach", "relation": "contains", "tail": "iron", "context": "General"},
    {"head": "coffee", "relation": "inhibits", "tail": "iron absorption", "context": "General"}
  ]
}

You are an expert Knowledge Graph Engineer specialized in Diet, Nutrition, and Lifestyle.
Your goal is to extract **meaningful guidelines and facts** from the text.

You must follow a **2-Step Forced Chain of Thought** process.

## Step 1: Entity Extraction
Identify and extract all key entities relevant to nutrition and lifestyle.
* **Scope**: Include foods, nutrients, health conditions, demographics, activities, measurements, and physiological effects.
* **Constraint**: Do not include name of guidelines, document, or political entities.

## Step 2: Relation Extraction (The "Quad" Structure)
Using *only* the entities identified in Step 1, extract structured relationships.
* **Head**: The subject entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Relation**: A concise, descriptive verb phrase capturing the interaction (e.g., "increases risk of", "is rich in", "recommends", "should avoid"). You are free to define the relation based on the text.
* **Tail**: The object entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Context**: (String) Any condition, timing, dosage, or constraint (e.g., "daily", "if pregnant"). If none, use "General".

## Robustness Rules
1.  **Grounding**: Every Head and Tail in the quads MUST be strictly selected from the `extracted_entities` list.
2.  **Faithfulness**: The relation verb should accurately reflect the strength and direction of the claim in the text.

## Few-Shot Example
**Input**:
"To prevent anemia, women should eat spinach because it contains iron. However, coffee can inhibit iron absorption."

**Output**:
```json
{
  "extracted_entities": [
    "anemia", "women", "spinach", "iron", "coffee", "iron absorption"
  ],
  "quads": [
    {"head": "spinach", "relation": "helps prevent", "tail": "anemia", "context": "General"},
    {"head": "women", "relation": "should eat", "tail": "spinach", "context": "To prevent anemia"},
    {"head": "spinach", "relation": "contains", "tail": "iron", "context": "General"},
    {"head": "coffee", "relation": "inhibits", "tail": "iron absorption", "context": "General"}
  ]
}

```

## Output Requirements
Output valid JSON object covered between ```json and ```.

## Text to Analyze:
3.1. Eatwell Guide food groups and supporting information

### Fruit and vegetables

Over a third of the diet should come from fruit and
vegetables.

Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and
vegetables every day. A portion is 80g or one of the
following:

            - a slice of a large fruit such as a melon

            - a whole piece of fruit such as an apple or banana

            - two pieces of small fruit such as satsumas

            - three tablespoons of cooked vegetables

            - a bowl of mixed salad

Limit the consumption of 100% fruit and vegetable juices
and/or smoothies to a combined total of 150ml (one
portion) per day and consume with meals to reduce the risk
of tooth decay.

30g (1 heaped tablespoon) of dried fruit (such as
raisins and apricots) also counts as one portion.
Consume at mealtimes rather than as a between
meal snack to reduce the risk of tooth decay.

### Potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy carbohydrates

Base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy
carbohydrates; choosing wholegrain versions where
possible. This includes wholewheat pasta, brown rice, or
simply leaving the skins on potatoes.

Wholegrain food contains more fibre than white or refined
starchy food, and often more of other nutrients too.

A Quick Guide to the Government’s Healthy Eating Recommendations

### Dairy and alternatives

Have some dairy and alternatives; choosing lower fat and
lower sugar options.

Look at labels and choose milks lower in fat, such as
skimmed, 1% or semi-skimmed; yoghurts lower in fat and
sugar and cheeses lower in fat and salt.

When buying dairy alternatives like soya drinks, go for
unsweetened, calcium-fortified versions.

### Beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins

Eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other
proteins (including 2 portions of fish every week, one of
which should be oily).

Beans, peas and lentils (which are all types of pulses) are
good alternatives to meat because they’re naturally very
low in fat, and they’re high in fibre, protein, vitamins and
minerals. Try adding them to soups, stews and ragùs to
make your meal go further.

Aim for at least two portions (2 x 140g) of fish a week,
including a portion of oily fish. Oily fish includes salmon,
sardines, mackerel and kippers.

On average eat no more than 70g red and processed meat
a day. Processed meat includes sausages, bacon, cured
meats and reformed meat products.

Some types of meat are high in fat, particularly saturated
fat. When buying meat:

            - choose lean cuts of meat

            - go for leaner mince

             - cut the fat off of meat and the skin off of chicken

             - try to grill or steam meat and fish instead of frying
A Quick Guide to the Government’s Healthy Eating Recommendations

### Oil and spreads

Choose unsaturated oils and spreads and eat in small amounts.

Although some fat in the diet is essential, generally we are
eating too much saturated fat.

Unsaturated fats are healthier fats that are usually from
plant sources and in liquid form as oil. This includes
vegetable oil, rapeseed oil and olive oil; as well as spreads
made from these oils.

All types of fat are high in energy and should be limited in
the diet.

### Foods high in fat, salt and sugar

Eat less often and in small amounts.

This includes products such as chocolate, cakes, biscuits,
full-sugar soft drinks, butter, cream and ice-cream.

These foods are not needed in the diet and so, if included,
should only be consumed infrequently and in
small amounts.

Check the label and avoid foods which are high in fat, salt
and sugar.

### Aim to drink 6-8 glasses of fluid every day

Water, lower fat milk and sugar-free drinks including tea
and coffee all count.

100% fruit and vegetable juices and smoothies also count
towards your fluid consumption, although they are a source
of free sugars and so you should limit consumption to no
more than a combined total of 150ml per day.
A Quick Guide to the Government’s Healthy Eating Recommendations

Swap sugary soft drinks for diet, sugar-free or no added
sugar varieties to reduce your sugar intake in a simple
step.

### Food labelling

Food labels can help you to choose
between foods and to pick those that are

lower in energy, fat, saturated fat, sugars
and salt.

Where colour coded labels are used you can tell at a glance if they are
high, medium or low in fat, saturated fat, sugars and salt.

For a healthier choice, try to pick products with more greens and ambers
and fewer reds.

### Daily energy requirements

We all need different amounts of energy (or calories) from food to be a
healthy weight. How much you need depends on a number of factors,
including how active you are. Whenever we eat more than our body
needs, we put on weight.

The average energy requirement for a man is about 10.5 MJ (2,500 kcal);
8.4MJ (2,000 kcal) for a woman. For more information on nutrient
requirements please see the link provided in the Government Dietary
Recommendations section below.

By convention [i] :

           - breakfast should provide about 1.7 MJ/400kcal of your energy

           - lunch about 2.5 MJ/600kcal

           - evening meal about 2.5 MJ/600kcal

           - leaving 1.7 MJ/ 400kcal for all the snacks and drinks consumed

between meals

3.2. Supplements

Most of us can get all the nutrients we need by consuming a healthy,
balanced and varied diet. However, **there are certain groups of the**
**population for whom certain dietary supplements are recommended** :

### Folic acid

**Women who could become pregnant or who are planning a**
**pregnancy** should take a dietary supplement of 400 micrograms (µg) of
folic acid every day from before conception until the 12th week of
pregnancy, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina
bifida.

Women who have an increased risk of having a pregnancy affected by an
NTD, including those who had a previous NTD affected pregnancy and
those with a family history of NTDs, are advised to take a higher dose of 5
milligrams (mg) of folic acid each day until the 12th week of pregnancy.

In addition to taking folic acid supplements, all pregnant women should eat
folate rich foods such as green vegetables, some fruits (oranges for
example) and fortified breakfast cereals.

### Vitamin D

It is recommended  that between the months of October and March
**everyone aged five years and above including pregnant and**
**breastfeeding women** should consider taking a supplement containing
10µg of vitamin D per day [ii] . There are separate recommendations for
children from birth to four years of age.

Between late March/early April and the end of September, the majority of people
aged five years and above will probably obtain sufficient vitamin D from sunlight
when they are outdoors so they might choose not to take a vitamin D supplement
during these months.

However, some groups of people will not obtain enough vitamin D from sunlight
because they have very little or no sunshine exposure. People from these groups

ii This is due to the fact that vitamin D is only found in a small number of foods and so it might be difficult to get
enough from foods that naturally contain vitamin D and/or fortified foods alone. This recommendation refers to the
average amount of vitamin D consumed over a period of time (eg a week) and takes account of day to day
variations in vitamin D intake.
A Quick Guide to the Government’s Healthy Eating Recommendations

should take a daily supplement containing 10µg vitamin D throughout the year.
They are:

       - people who are seldom outdoors such as frail or housebound individuals and
those who are confined indoors eg in institutions such as care homes

       - people who habitually wear clothes that cover most of their skin while outdoors

People from minority ethnic groups with dark skin such as those with African,
African-Caribbean and South Asian origin might not get enough vitamin D from
sunlight in summer, so they should consider taking a daily supplement containing
10µg vitamin D throughout the year.

### Vitamins A and C

**Infants and young children aged between six months and five years**
should also be given a supplement containing vitamins A and C. Babies
under six months of age should not need supplements containing vitamin A
and C as their body stores of nutrients (obtained from the mother during
pregnancy) and breast milk or infant formula intake should be adequate to
meet their needs. Formula fed infants should not need vitamin
supplements until they are having less than 500ml of formula a day, as
formula is fortified with vitamins and minerals.

Children who have a good appetite and eat a wide variety of foods,
including fruit and vegetables, might not need vitamin supplements.
Parents who are concerned about their child’s diet should talk to their GP
or health visitor for further advice.

You are a Data Cleaning Specialist.
Your task is to identify and resolve duplicate entities from a list of nutrition and lifestyle terms.

## Task
Review the input list of entities. Group terms that refer to the **same concept** (synonyms, abbreviations, plural variations, or case differences).
For each group, select one **Canonical Alias** that is the clearest representation of the concept.

## Output Schema
Return a JSON object with a list of "resolutions".
* `duplicate_group`: A list of the variations found in the input (including the canonical one).
* `canonical_form`: The single best name to use for the group.

## Example
**Input Entities**:
["cardio", "Cardiovascular exercise", "running", "run", "Vit D", "Vitamin D"]

**Output**:
```json
{
  "resolutions": [
    {
      "duplicate_group": ["cardio", "Cardiovascular exercise"],
      "canonical_form": "Cardiovascular exercise"
    },
    {
      "duplicate_group": ["running", "run"],
      "canonical_form": "running"
    },
    {
      "duplicate_group": ["Vit D", "Vitamin D"],
      "canonical_form": "Vitamin D"
    }
  ]
}

You are an expert Knowledge Graph Engineer specialized in Diet, Nutrition, and Lifestyle.
Your goal is to extract **meaningful guidelines and facts** from the text.

You must follow a **2-Step Forced Chain of Thought** process.

## Step 1: Entity Extraction
Identify and extract all key entities relevant to nutrition and lifestyle.
* **Scope**: Include foods, nutrients, health conditions, demographics, activities, measurements, and physiological effects.
* **Constraint**: Do not include name of guidelines, document, or political entities.

## Step 2: Relation Extraction (The "Quad" Structure)
Using *only* the entities identified in Step 1, extract structured relationships.
* **Head**: The subject entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Relation**: A concise, descriptive verb phrase capturing the interaction (e.g., "increases risk of", "is rich in", "recommends", "should avoid"). You are free to define the relation based on the text.
* **Tail**: The object entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Context**: (String) Any condition, timing, dosage, or constraint (e.g., "daily", "if pregnant"). If none, use "General".

## Robustness Rules
1.  **Grounding**: Every Head and Tail in the quads MUST be strictly selected from the `extracted_entities` list.
2.  **Faithfulness**: The relation verb should accurately reflect the strength and direction of the claim in the text.

## Few-Shot Example
**Input**:
"To prevent anemia, women should eat spinach because it contains iron. However, coffee can inhibit iron absorption."

**Output**:
```json
{
  "extracted_entities": [
    "anemia", "women", "spinach", "iron", "coffee", "iron absorption"
  ],
  "quads": [
    {"head": "spinach", "relation": "helps prevent", "tail": "anemia", "context": "General"},
    {"head": "women", "relation": "should eat", "tail": "spinach", "context": "To prevent anemia"},
    {"head": "spinach", "relation": "contains", "tail": "iron", "context": "General"},
    {"head": "coffee", "relation": "inhibits", "tail": "iron absorption", "context": "General"}
  ]
}

```

## Output Requirements
Output valid JSON object covered between ```json and ```.

You are a Data Cleaning Specialist.
Your task is to identify and resolve duplicate entities from a list of nutrition and lifestyle terms.

## Task
Review the input list of entities. Group terms that refer to the **same concept** (synonyms, abbreviations, plural variations, or case differences).
For each group, select one **Canonical Alias** that is the clearest representation of the concept.

## Output Schema
Return a JSON object with a list of "resolutions".
* `duplicate_group`: A list of the variations found in the input (including the canonical one).
* `canonical_form`: The single best name to use for the group.

## Example
**Input Entities**:
["cardio", "Cardiovascular exercise", "running", "run", "Vit D", "Vitamin D"]

**Output**:
```json
{
  "resolutions": [
    {
      "duplicate_group": ["cardio", "Cardiovascular exercise"],
      "canonical_form": "Cardiovascular exercise"
    },

Find duplicate entities from a list of diet lifestyle terms and an alias that best represents the duplicates.
Duplicates are those that are the same in meaning, such as with variation in tense, plural form, stem form, case, abbreviation, shorthand.

## Output Schema
Return a JSON object with a list of "resolutions".
* `duplicate_group`: A list of the variations found in the input (including the canonical one).
* `canonical_form`: The single best name to use for the group.

## Example
**Input Entities**:
["meat", "meats", "Diabetes", "Vit D", "Vitamin D"]

**Output**:
```json
{
  "resolutions": [
    {
      "duplicate_group": ["meat", "meats"],
      "canonical_form": "meat"
    },
    {
      "duplicate_group": ["Vit D", "Vitamin D"],
      "canonical_form": "Vitamin D"
    }
  ]
}

```

## Extracted Entities:
"healthy eating", "fruits", "vegetables", "starchy carbohydrates", "whole grain varieties", "potatoes", "bread", "rice", "pasta", "dairy", "dairy alternatives", "protein", "beans", "pulses", "fish", "eggs", "meat", "unsaturated oils", "spreads", "water", "sugary drinks", "saturated fat", "salt", "sugar", "calories", "adults", "children", "obesity", "heart disease", "type 2 diabetes", "some cancers", "dental caries", "weight gain", "health", "energy", "nutrients", "hydration"

## Execution

You are a nutrionalist that extracts key Diet, Nutrition, and Lifestyle related entities from the Source Text.

You must follow a **2-Step Forced Chain of Thought** process.

## Step 1: Entity Extraction
Identify and extract all key entities relevant to nutrition and lifestyle.
* **Scope**: Include foods, nutrients, health conditions, demographics, and physiological effects.
* **Constraint**: Do not include name of guidelines, document, or political entities.

## Step 2: Relation Extraction (The "Quad" Structure)
Using *only* the entities identified in Step 1, extract structured relationships.
* **Head**: The subject entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Relation**: A concise, descriptive phrase capturing the interaction (e.g., "increases risk of", "is rich in", "recommends", "should avoid"). 
* **Tail**: The object entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Context**: (String) Any condition, timing, dosage, or constraint (e.g., "daily", "if pregnant"). Use "General" by default.

## Robustness Rules
1.  **Grounding**: Every Head and Tail in the quads MUST be strictly selected from Step 1 result.
2.  **Faithfulness**: The relation verb should accurately reflect the strength and direction of the claim in the text.

## Few-Shot Example
**Input**:
"To prevent anemia, women should eat spinach because it contains iron. However, coffee can inhibit iron absorption."

**Output**:
```json
{
  "extracted_entities": [
    "anemia", "women", "spinach", "iron", "coffee", "iron absorption"
  ],
  "quads": [
    {"head": "spinach", "relation": "helps prevent", "tail": "anemia", "context": "General"},

dietary recommendations. The original Quick Guide to Government Healthy
Eating Recommendations has been available on the Healthier and more
Sustainable Catering webpage on GOV.UK since February 2014.

1.2. This document is aimed at catering providers to support healthier catering

provision, health professionals (including dietitians and nutritionists), teachers,
university students, academics, industry and is also a source of information for
the general population. It provides a summary of government dietary advice and
nutrient recommendations throughout the lifecourse.

1.3. Government healthy eating recommendations are visually depicted in the

Eatwell Guide  and are based on recommendations from the World Health
Organisation (WHO) , Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy
(COMA)  and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) [6,7,8,9,10,11 ]

that succeeded COMA in 2000.

1.4. This document provides a concise summary of government’s healthy eating

recommendations and signposts to the evidence upon which they are based.

3.1. Eatwell Guide food groups and supporting information

### Fruit and vegetables

Over a third of the diet should come from fruit and
vegetables.

Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and
vegetables every day. A portion is 80g or one of the
following:

            - a slice of a large fruit such as a melon

            - a whole piece of fruit such as an apple or banana

            - two pieces of small fruit such as satsumas

            - three tablespoons of cooked vegetables

            - a bowl of mixed salad

Limit the consumption of 100% fruit and vegetable juices
and/or smoothies to a combined total of 150ml (one
portion) per day and consume with meals to reduce the risk
of tooth decay.

30g (1 heaped tablespoon) of dried fruit (such as
raisins and apricots) also counts as one portion.
Consume at mealtimes rather than as a between
meal snack to reduce the risk of tooth decay.

### Potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy carbohydrates

Base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy
carbohydrates; choosing wholegrain versions where
possible. This includes wholewheat pasta, brown rice, or
simply leaving the skins on potatoes.

Wholegrain food contains more fibre than white or refined
starchy food, and often more of other nutrients too.

A Quick Guide to the Government’s Healthy Eating Recommendations

### Dairy and alternatives

Have some dairy and alternatives; choosing lower fat and
lower sugar options.

Look at labels and choose milks lower in fat, such as
skimmed, 1% or semi-skimmed; yoghurts lower in fat and
sugar and cheeses lower in fat and salt.

When buying dairy alternatives like soya drinks, go for
unsweetened, calcium-fortified versions.

### Beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins

Eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other
proteins (including 2 portions of fish every week, one of
which should be oily).

Beans, peas and lentils (which are all types of pulses) are
good alternatives to meat because they’re naturally very
low in fat, and they’re high in fibre, protein, vitamins and
minerals. Try adding them to soups, stews and ragùs to
make your meal go further.

Aim for at least two portions (2 x 140g) of fish a week,
including a portion of oily fish. Oily fish includes salmon,
sardines, mackerel and kippers.

On average eat no more than 70g red and processed meat
a day. Processed meat includes sausages, bacon, cured
meats and reformed meat products.

Some types of meat are high in fat, particularly saturated
fat. When buying meat:

            - choose lean cuts of meat

            - go for leaner mince

             - cut the fat off of meat and the skin off of chicken

             - try to grill or steam meat and fish instead of frying
A Quick Guide to the Government’s Healthy Eating Recommendations

### Oil and spreads

Choose unsaturated oils and spreads and eat in small amounts.

Although some fat in the diet is essential, generally we are
eating too much saturated fat.

Unsaturated fats are healthier fats that are usually from
plant sources and in liquid form as oil. This includes
vegetable oil, rapeseed oil and olive oil; as well as spreads
made from these oils.

All types of fat are high in energy and should be limited in
the diet.

### Foods high in fat, salt and sugar

Eat less often and in small amounts.

This includes products such as chocolate, cakes, biscuits,
full-sugar soft drinks, butter, cream and ice-cream.

These foods are not needed in the diet and so, if included,
should only be consumed infrequently and in
small amounts.

Check the label and avoid foods which are high in fat, salt
and sugar.

### Aim to drink 6-8 glasses of fluid every day

Water, lower fat milk and sugar-free drinks including tea
and coffee all count.

100% fruit and vegetable juices and smoothies also count
towards your fluid consumption, although they are a source
of free sugars and so you should limit consumption to no
more than a combined total of 150ml per day.
A Quick Guide to the Government’s Healthy Eating Recommendations

Swap sugary soft drinks for diet, sugar-free or no added
sugar varieties to reduce your sugar intake in a simple
step.

### Food labelling

Food labels can help you to choose
between foods and to pick those that are

lower in energy, fat, saturated fat, sugars
and salt.

Where colour coded labels are used you can tell at a glance if they are
high, medium or low in fat, saturated fat, sugars and salt.

For a healthier choice, try to pick products with more greens and ambers
and fewer reds.

### Daily energy requirements

We all need different amounts of energy (or calories) from food to be a
healthy weight. How much you need depends on a number of factors,
including how active you are. Whenever we eat more than our body
needs, we put on weight.

The average energy requirement for a man is about 10.5 MJ (2,500 kcal);
8.4MJ (2,000 kcal) for a woman. For more information on nutrient
requirements please see the link provided in the Government Dietary
Recommendations section below.

By convention [i] :

           - breakfast should provide about 1.7 MJ/400kcal of your energy

           - lunch about 2.5 MJ/600kcal

           - evening meal about 2.5 MJ/600kcal

           - leaving 1.7 MJ/ 400kcal for all the snacks and drinks consumed

between meals

3.2. Supplements

Most of us can get all the nutrients we need by consuming a healthy,
balanced and varied diet. However, **there are certain groups of the**
**population for whom certain dietary supplements are recommended** :

### Folic acid

**Women who could become pregnant or who are planning a**
**pregnancy** should take a dietary supplement of 400 micrograms (µg) of
folic acid every day from before conception until the 12th week of
pregnancy, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina
bifida.

Women who have an increased risk of having a pregnancy affected by an
NTD, including those who had a previous NTD affected pregnancy and
those with a family history of NTDs, are advised to take a higher dose of 5
milligrams (mg) of folic acid each day until the 12th week of pregnancy.

In addition to taking folic acid supplements, all pregnant women should eat
folate rich foods such as green vegetables, some fruits (oranges for
example) and fortified breakfast cereals.

### Vitamin D

It is recommended  that between the months of October and March
**everyone aged five years and above including pregnant and**
**breastfeeding women** should consider taking a supplement containing
10µg of vitamin D per day [ii] . There are separate recommendations for
children from birth to four years of age.

Between late March/early April and the end of September, the majority of people
aged five years and above will probably obtain sufficient vitamin D from sunlight
when they are outdoors so they might choose not to take a vitamin D supplement
during these months.

However, some groups of people will not obtain enough vitamin D from sunlight
because they have very little or no sunshine exposure. People from these groups

ii This is due to the fact that vitamin D is only found in a small number of foods and so it might be difficult to get
enough from foods that naturally contain vitamin D and/or fortified foods alone. This recommendation refers to the
average amount of vitamin D consumed over a period of time (eg a week) and takes account of day to day
variations in vitamin D intake.
A Quick Guide to the Government’s Healthy Eating Recommendations

should take a daily supplement containing 10µg vitamin D throughout the year.
They are:

       - people who are seldom outdoors such as frail or housebound individuals and
those who are confined indoors eg in institutions such as care homes

       - people who habitually wear clothes that cover most of their skin while outdoors

People from minority ethnic groups with dark skin such as those with African,
African-Caribbean and South Asian origin might not get enough vitamin D from
sunlight in summer, so they should consider taking a daily supplement containing
10µg vitamin D throughout the year.

### Vitamins A and C

**Infants and young children aged between six months and five years**
should also be given a supplement containing vitamins A and C. Babies
under six months of age should not need supplements containing vitamin A
and C as their body stores of nutrients (obtained from the mother during
pregnancy) and breast milk or infant formula intake should be adequate to
meet their needs. Formula fed infants should not need vitamin
supplements until they are having less than 500ml of formula a day, as
formula is fortified with vitamins and minerals.

Children who have a good appetite and eat a wide variety of foods,
including fruit and vegetables, might not need vitamin supplements.
Parents who are concerned about their child’s diet should talk to their GP
or health visitor for further advice.

You are a nutrionalist that extracts key Diet, Nutrition, and Lifestyle related entities from the Source Text.

You must follow a **2-Step Forced Chain of Thought** process.

## Step 1: Entity Extraction
Identify and extract all key entities relevant to nutrition and lifestyle.
* **Scope**: Include foods, nutrients, health conditions, demographics, and physiological effects.
* **Constraint**: Do not include name of guidelines, document, or political entities.

## Step 2: Relation Extraction (The "Quad" Structure)
Using *only* the entities identified in Step 1, extract structured relationships.
* **Head**: The subject entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Relation**: A concise, descriptive phrase capturing the interaction (e.g., "increases risk of", "is rich in", "recommends", "should avoid"). 
* **Tail**: The object entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Context**: (String) Any condition, timing, dosage, or constraint (e.g., "daily", "if pregnant"). Use "General" by default.

## Robustness Rules
1.  **Grounding**: Every Head and Tail in the quads MUST be strictly selected from Step 1 result.
2.  **Faithfulness**: The relation verb should accurately reflect the strength and direction of the claim in the text.

## Few-Shot Example
**Input**:
"To prevent anemia, women should eat spinach because it contains iron. However, coffee can inhibit iron absorption."

**Output**:
```json
{
  "extracted_entities": [
    "anemia", "women", "spinach", "iron", "coffee", "iron absorption"

Find duplicate entities from a list of diet lifestyle terms and an alias that best represents the duplicates.
Duplicates are those that are the same in meaning, such as with variation in tense, plural form, stem form, case, abbreviation, shorthand.

## Output Schema
Return a JSON object with a list of "resolutions".
* `duplicate_group`: A list of the variations found in the input (including the canonical one).
* `canonical_form`: The single best name to use for the group.

## Example
**Input Entities**:
["meat", "meats", "Diabetes", "Vit D", "Vitamin D"]

**Output**:
```json
{
  "resolutions": [
    {
      "duplicate_group": ["meat", "meats"],
      "canonical_form": "meat"
    },
    {
      "duplicate_group": ["Vit D", "Vitamin D"],
      "canonical_form": "Vitamin D"
    }
  ]
}

```

## Extracted Entities:
"males", "females", "food energy", "macronutrients", "micronutrients", "salt", "free sugar", "dietary fibre"

## Execution
Start duplicate analysis, and output valid JSON object covered between ```json and ```.

You are a nutrionalist that extracts key Diet, Nutrition, and Lifestyle related entities from the Source Text.

You must follow a **2-Step Forced Chain of Thought** process.

## Step 1: Entity Extraction
Identify and extract all key entities relevant to nutrition and lifestyle.
* **Scope**: Include foods, nutrients, health conditions, demographics, and physiological effects.
* **Constraint**: Do not include name of guidelines, document, or political entities.

## Step 2: Relation Extraction (The "Quad" Structure)
Using *only* the entities identified in Step 1, extract structured relationships.
* **Head**: The subject entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Relation**: A concise, descriptive phrase capturing the interaction (e.g., "increases risk of", "is rich in", "recommends", "should avoid"). 
* **Tail**: The object entity (Must be in Step 1 list).
* **Context**: (String) Any condition, timing, dosage, or constraint (e.g., "daily", "if pregnant"). Use "General" by default.

## Robustness Rules
1.  **Grounding**: Every Head and Tail in the quads MUST be strictly selected from Step 1 result.
2.  **Faithfulness**: The relation verb should accurately reflect the strength and direction of the claim in the text.

## Few-Shot Example
**Input**:
"To prevent anemia, women should eat spinach because it contains iron. However, coffee can inhibit iron absorption."

**Output**:
```json
{
  "extracted_entities": [
    "anemia", "women", "spinach", "iron", "coffee", "iron absorption"
  ],
  "quads": [
    {"head": "spinach", "relation": "helps prevent", "tail": "anemia", "context": "General"},
    {"head": "women", "relation": "should eat", "tail": "spinach", "context": "To prevent anemia"},
    {"head": "spinach", "relation": "contains", "tail": "iron", "context": "General"},
    {"head": "coffee", "relation": "inhibits", "tail": "iron absorption", "context": "General"}
  ]
}
